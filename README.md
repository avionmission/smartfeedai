# SmartFeedAI
SmartFeedAi is uses AI to helps users browse through online content efficiently. It uses NLP AI algorithms to generate a short summary of an article's content when users input a URL. 

Personal blogs provide a unique perspective that AI cannot replicate. Contrary to fear-mongering that blogging will see a decline because of Ai, Ai can assist readers who love online reading by providing short summaries of articles that they might be interested in, this is what SmartFeedAi does.
